# In this use case the button triggers interactions with support and delivery team
#
# Alice says to Bob: you already know managed services from Dimension Data.
# Here is a new way to engage with us.
# Press the button when needed, and our teams will interact over a Cisco Spark room and over mobile phones.
#
# 1- Bob has a problem, and presses the button.
#    This creates a room, adds some people from the teams of Alice and of Bob, and pushes some content to it.
#    Interactions can start asynchronously with chat and files.
#    When people enter the room they can discuss and move forward.
#
# 2- If people in the team of Alice are too busy they may not pop up immediately.
#    In that case, Bob presses the button a second time.
#    This sends SMS to Alice, and that action is recorded in the room.
#
# 3- A third press on the button triggers a phone call to Alice, so that she is invited to join the room immediately.
#
# Benefits for Alice, the client:
# - easy way to bring people together on incident
# - allow people to interact from mobile, tablet, laptop or web browser
# - any expert can be added and provided with contextual information in the room
# - preserve history of exchanges in the room itself
# - blur difference between synchronous/asynchronous interactions
# - assistance is personalised from the beginning to the end
#
# Benefits for Bob, the provider:
# - chat and visual feed-back are better than phone call and e-mail
# - easy channel for questions and requests from the client
# - single place to share unstructured information (logs, screenshots, etc.)
# - ask any expert to join the room for contribution
# - incident managers can monitor all interactions between people
# - support both shared and dedicated organisation models
