# In this use case the button triggers interactions with support and delivery team
#
# A permanent room is created in Cisco Spark so that client and provider can interact
# at will, and preserve context information over time
#
# When client pushes the button a notification is sent to the room, and a SMS
# to sales person. The client goes to the room and asks a question or submits an idea,
# either before or after a push on the button. If the provider joins the room on SMS,
# he can stick to the chat room or even switch to audio/video interaction with the client.
#
# When client pushes the button a second time within some minutes, then a voice call
# is made to the sales person. The sales person knows that there is an urgent case
# to handle, and can either move to the room, send a SMS, or find other ways to
# interact with the client.
#
# Benefits for the client:
# - easy way to bring people together on incident
# - allow people to interact from mobile, tablet, laptop or web browser
# - any expert can be added and provided with contextual information in the room
# - preserve history of exchanges in the room itself
# - blur difference between synchronous/asynchronous interactions
# - assistance is personalised from the beginning to the end
#
# Benefits for the provider:
# - chat and visual feed-back are better than phone call and e-mail
# - easy channel for questions and requests from the client
# - single place to share unstructured information (logs, screenshots, etc.)
# - ask any expert to join the room for contribution
# - incident managers can monitor all interactions between people
# - support both shared and dedicated organisation models
